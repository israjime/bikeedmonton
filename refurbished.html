            no others.)</b

        <li>
          <b>Available bikes are updated daily.</b> We cannot reserve bikes, so
          your choices may be sold before your appointment. If that happens,
          we’ll do our best to suggest other options for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bikes are fully refurbished by professional mechanics.</b> We
          prioritize function, so bikes may have appropriate, but aesthetically
          mismatched, parts. When you buy a bike from us, it will be genuinely
          one-of-a-kind!

            our services for Edmonton residents.</b
          >
          If you are not a resident of Edmonton, we encourage you to look at
          private marketplaces and commercial bike shops rather than us.

        <li>
          <b
            >Bikes are like shoes: you can guess fit by size, but you should
            always try them out.</b
          >
          We put a lot of love into our bikes, and we’re devoted to matching one
          with your needs. It’s why we insist that the intended rider is present
          to try the bike in person. We do not offer exchanges or refunds on
          used bicycles, so we want to make sure you and your bike are a great
          match.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bikes can be viewed in-person by appointment only.</b> To book an
          appointment, view our bikes first and then use the “Book an
          Appointment” button.

        <li><b>We accept debit, Visa, Mastercard, and cash.</b></li>

        <b>As-Is Bikes.</b> We have a limited number of as-is bikes (not
        refurbished) available at our workshop. These bikes may not be
        ready-to-ride and they may be missing parts. Only bikes explicitly
        marked as-is are available for sale.

      <h1>NO APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE?</h1>
      <p>
        We do bike shopping appointments on Wednesday & Thursday evenings and
        Saturday & Sunday afternoons. Available bike shopping appointments
        appear no more than 48 hours before those times. For example, available
        Saturday afternoon appointments appear on the calendar on Thursday
        afternoon. If you try to book an appointment more than 48 hours in
        advance, you will not see any available. We also only book appointments
        one day at a time, so Sunday appointments will not be available until
        after closing time on Saturday.

          Our vision is a city where cycling is safe, widespread, and accessible
          to people of all comfort levels. Bike Edmonton acknowledges that we
          are located on Treaty 6 territory, a traditional gathering place for
          diverse Indigenous peoples including the Cree, Blackfoot, Métis,
          Nakota Sioux, Iroquois, Dene, Ojibway / Saulteaux / Anishinaabe,
          Inuit, and many others whose histories, languages, and cultures
          continue to influence our vibrant community. We acknowledge that we
          are all treaty people and we are committed to equity and justice for
          all our relations.
